# Meet The Team

<!-- Founded by concerned citizens, Food Rescue Philippines is bringing food to all. -->

<!-- Food Rescue Philippines is founded with the intention of eliminating food waste and involuntary hunger. -->


Food Rescue Philippines was initiated by Mac Florendo in September 2015 in Dumaguete City. 

The project aims to lessen food waste and to assist individuals that are in poverty or have low income. 

Mac and the volunteers use bicycles, skateboards, etc. as transportation in distributing and collecting the food. 

The movement has since expanded to Metro Manila where food rescues are coordinated with volunteers through Facebook Messenger.  

<!-- Reduces food wastes by assembling food from different establishments such as markets, business buildings, etc. The accumulated food will be distributed to homeless and low-income individuals to assist them in experiencing a meal at their tables. 

; this is to promote zero-emission and for environmental protection. -->
