## Frequently Asked Questions


{{< expand "What's Food Rescue?" >}}
You get the food waste from a wet market, restaurant, farm, etc. using your own transportation method. The most common method is by bicycle because the volume or weight varies. However, we promote the use of public transportation, such as with a stroller, to reduce the use of cars.

<!-- The main attraction for Mac to start Food Rescue was the use of bicycles in picking up and delivering food. The simple idea of biking around, helping people in need and reducing carbon footprint made Mac want to replicate the idea in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; -->
