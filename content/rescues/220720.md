## Collection Details

We did a food rescue in Fairview collecting the following:

Item | Social Points
--- | ---
2 large boxes of chocolates | 3
18 packets candies | 0.5
9 Irish cream drinks | 0.5
900 grams brocolli | 0.2
9 packets broth cubes | 0.1
1 kg sugar | 0.2
1 packet banana | 0*
250 grams cauliflower | 0
500 grams sitaw | 0
Total | **4.5 points**

<!-- > *The points are based on the most numerous item per box, for the ease of computation -->

> *Zero points means the item cannot be eaten or are have less parts that are edible


We took public transportation, spending 90 pesos for 2 people taking 2 trips since the large boxes were bulky. The idea is to lower the money cost of doing food rescue in order to make it sustainable.

Social Points | 4.5


## Beneficiary Details

We were supposed to give the collection to a charity group in a nearby squatter community. But our contact there was unavailable. He was afraid that distributing the chocolates without their group in place would lead to a crowd forming. 

So we gave the food instead to the staff of a nearby restaurant and to some children along Commonwealth Avenue in Tandang Sora Quezon City.
