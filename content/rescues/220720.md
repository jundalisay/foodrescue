We did a food rescue in Fairview collecting the following;

- 2 large boxes of chocolates
- 18 packets candies
- 9 Irish cream drinks
- 900 grams brocolli
- 9 packets broth cubes 
- 1 kg sugar
- 1 packet banana
- 250 grams cauliflower
- 500 grams sitaw

We took public transportation, spending 90 pesos for 2 people taking 2 trips. The idea is to lower the money cost of doing food rescue in order to make it sustainable.
