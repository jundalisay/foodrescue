We did a food rescue in Fairview collecting the following:

- 2 large boxes of chocolates (3 points*)
- 18 packets candies (0.5 points)
- 9 Irish cream drinks
- 900 grams brocolli (0.5 points)
- 9 packets broth cubes 
- 1 kg sugar
- 1 packet banana
- 250 grams cauliflower
- 500 grams sitaw

> *The points are based on the most numerous item per box, for the ease of computation


We took public transportation, spending 90 pesos for 2 people taking 2 trips. The idea is to lower the money cost of doing food rescue in order to make it sustainable.   

We then gave half of the food to children in Tandang Sora Quezon City and the other half to a community in San Mateo Rizal.
